# Titanic_Survival_Rate_Classification (Multi-layer Perceptron)

The dataset we used for the MLP was the Titanic Survival Dataset. This dataset conveyed 
whether passengers survived the sinking. There are two files in our dataset train.csv and 
test.csv. Train.csv has all the data we are going to train the model with. Test.csv has all the 
same data except the “survived” column, this is because we need to test our model on unseen 
data.
